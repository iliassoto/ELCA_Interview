- Variable naming, parameters naming.
- Method naming.
- Class should be called Employee instead of Person.
- Comments.
- Edge case: A single employee is defined by ist id, not by it's name and Email.
- Bugfix: Email is missing when writing a row to the CSV file.
- To discuss: add_to_db should be a static method? Design-wise maybe not the best. This method should be in a separate class that handles the "DB".
- Hardcoded file_path
- Close filereaders as soon as the information is needed.
- Return types as hints
